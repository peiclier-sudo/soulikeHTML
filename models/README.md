# Models folder

Place these files here so the game can use them:

- **boss1.glb** – Boss character model with animations (Idle, Walk, Run, Attack, etc.).  
  Copy from your Downloads or export from your 3D tool.  
  If missing, the game uses a simple procedural boss.

- **character.glb** – Player character (already used if present).

- **claymore.glb** (optional) – Custom sword model. If missing, a procedural sword is used.
